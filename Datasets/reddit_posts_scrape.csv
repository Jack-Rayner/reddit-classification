"AskScience AMA Series: Molecular engineering (MolE) encompasses everything from protein design, nanomaterials, vaccine development, battery/solar cell design, &amp; much more. We're a group of students, professors &amp; staff connected to the University of Washington's MolE Institute. AUA about MolE!","We are graduate students, staff, and faculty from the University of Washington Molecular Engineering and Science (MolES) Institute. Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though MolES only opened in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!

Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the object-level behavior of something by precisely altering it on the molecular level - given knowledge of how molecules in that ""something"" interacts with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are endless! Some specific examples of Molecular Engineering research being done within the labs of the MolES Institute are:

1. MolES faculty member and Chemistry professor Al Nelson developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals and preserve them in portable, modular ""biofactories"" embedded in water-based gels known as hydrogels. This approach could enable access to critical medicines and other compounds in low-resource areas.
2. The Baker lab in MolES and Biochemistry is engineering artificial proteins to self-assemble on a crystal surface. The ability to program these interactions could enable the design of new biomimetic materials with customized chemical reactivity or mechanical properties, that can serve as scaffolds for nano-filters, solar cells or electronic circuits.
3. Bioengineering/MolES Institute Professor Kelly Stevens developed a new 3D printing approach to create biocompatible hydrogels with life-like vasculature - opening the possibility of printing living human tissue for things like organ replacement!
4. Researchers in MolES and Chemical Engineering professor Elizabeth Nance's lab are attempting to deliver therapeutics to the brain using tiny nanoparticles that can effectively cross the blood-brain-barrier in brain injury and disease.
5. MolES PhD student Jason Fontana is working in the labs of James Carothers and Jesse Zalatan to develop tools that facilitate genetic engineering in bacteria for optimizing biosynthesis of valuable products.

Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to further general awareness of our discipline!

Modern propaganda is far more dangerous than it used to be,"Propaganda has been a staple in geopolitics for a long time. 

It's nothing new to shape the public opinion and the idea of doing so may even be necessary.

However - today's propaganda is much different from what it was even just 30 years ago. 

Propaganda today is swift, organized, and more importantly easily concealed and distributed for consumption.

[It was illegal for the Pentagon to produce propaganda targeted at the American populace until 2013](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/)

Now cheap venues such as Netflix, which is affordable to most, can be used as mouthpieces for propaganda. Entire shows can be produced by the Pentagon and you will have no idea.

We have moved past [traditional means](https://imgur.com/a/j2TObzx) and moved into grey territory.

Propaganda can now affect you without being obvious about it. Your main character you root for in a show can be written in a way that you now sympathize with something you may not have before. 

Astroturfing and trolling have also reached points where forums such as Reddit have become nearly unviable. 

To be more clearly stated my unpopular opinion is this:

Propaganda is distributed on both sides of a conflict and modern methods of distribution are harmful to society.",unpopularopinion,1646167335

Drinking alone isn't really that bad,"I don't agree with the belief that drinking alone is a sign of alcoholism. I also eat hamburgers alone, but I'm not at risk of being a burger fiend.

Some things that are better indicators of alcoholism:
- Drinking *excessively*
- Drinking to *self medicate*/*escape*/*sad*
- Always needing to drink to have fun
- Drinking when pressured
- Spending a lot on liquor

Sometimes mfs just want to relax at home with some alcohol. It doesn't need to be a social event to be ""ok"".

Literally people just need simple boundaries--if you're drinking more than 2x/wk, you probably need to check yourself. If you're getting drunk more than 2x/month, you maybe need to pump the brakes. If you're ever blacking/browning out, you're just not being smart about your drinking. If you keep getting hangovers, you're also not doing it right.",unpopularopinion,1646165863

In his older movies he would play the same cocky, obnoxious character over and over again, then he would just die.

In the 2000s, he's either taken up more cocky and obnoxious roles, or taken up roles where he's just some boring adult that's either in love or fighting for his life in an action movie.

In the early 2010s, I do admit he has some very good roles, but still none Oscar worthy. Now his roles consist of middle-aged men that scream all the time and think they're above everyone else. Loud acting can be good, but when it's in every single movie.

Personally, I think that botox looks worse than naturally aging. 
Sometimes a celeb with botox is only 30, but you can see that their face is both puffy and saggy in a really unnatural way. I have a friend who had a few sessions of botox, and the same thing happened to them, so it seems no matter how little you get, it ages you different

Watching and supporting content creators such as David Dobrik makes you a bad person,"It usually takes a lot for me to consider some people ‚Äúbad people‚Äù. And maybe there‚Äôs a better word to use here to describe the people I‚Äôm talking about but for now that‚Äôs the word I‚Äôm going with.

David Dobrik and his ‚Äúvlogsquad‚Äù group of content creators are truly some of the most awful people on the planet and you couldn‚Äôt tell me otherwise. I did not grow up watching Davids content, so I can‚Äôt play the ‚ÄúI watch because I‚Äôve watched from the beginning‚Äù card like some people do. If you are continuing to support him, watching his current content, or even worse, justifying anything that he has done in recent years then you are a stupid idiot and you‚Äôve been blinded by his celebrity status. His massive influence, especially on younger people is so dangerous and it‚Äôs creating people to think like he does. He doesn‚Äôt give a shit about his friends (re: Jeff Wittek), he doesn‚Äôt care about his fans AT ALL, and only cares about money and more influence. 

I cannot wait for the Casey Neistat documentary coming out about this loser. It sucks that people like him become they type of person he is today.

Violent criminals should be used for human experimentation,"Prison reform advocates say that death penalties and long sentences don't help anyone. Well this will. We can bolster scientific research by conducting far more tests on real people. Research is far too slow. People are suffering right now. What's the point of researching anything is everyone you care about would be dead by the time they could actually recieve the treatment due to such strict regulations?

Many advocates in my opinion are either hypocrites and if they aren't they're flat out demented. If someone were to seriously harm your young child or younger sibling you would have no reserves regarding what happened to the perpetrator. In fact. You would likely wish the worst for them. Yet if the victim of a violent crime is any other stranger. Especially if they arent a woman or child. Suddenly prison reform matters to you and you care how the perpetrator is treated.

Granted, the legal system is flawed and always will be to some extent. So I think this punishment should only be on the table, when the case is pretty open and shut with just about undisputable evidence. 

People will say otherwise but there's a clear difference when it comes to catching a criminal as they're committing an act with cameras and witnesses all around and hunting down someone and relying primarily on witness testimony alone. If every case was as cut and dry, there would be little to no need for interrogators. So experimentation should only be applied to prisoners who have absolutely no realistic way of claiming innocence.",unpopularopinion,1646160964

"The ""SuperStonk""/GME craze is cult-like and prays on the novice retail investor","Everyone in r/SuperStonk hypes up GME like it is guaranteed to increase 1000x in the near future. It's fine to form a hypothesis and believe it in, but these people are making unrealistic promises to low-income, retail investors in order to pump the stock. GME appeals to novice investors specifically, because simply dumping all your money into a single stock that is ""clearly going to the moon"" is a lot quicker and much less effort than building a three-fund portfolio with relatively low-risk index funds which will reliably yield growth over decades.

At the end of the day, we *cannot* say with any real degree of certainty what the future trend is going to be for GME. If the stock was practically guaranteed to become more valuable, its current price would already reflect that increase. There are organizations who pay millions of dollars to some of the smartest people alive to make stock picks, it is arrogant to assume you know something they don't.

I'm writing this post because I feel uneasy when I see someone with very little savings being encouraged to dump all of it into a single stock. To me, it comes off as a fervent bid to realize the gains they want to see by peer pressuring everybody else to buy in and hold. I just worry that the end result is going to be a considerable number of low-income retail investors losing relatively catastrophic amounts of money which they cannot afford to lose once the hype dies off.",unpopularopinion,1646160500

You're being impolite if you expect others to wait to eat until you get your food.,"It doesn't matter where or when.

If the food at the restaurant comes out for 5/7 people in the group, those people can and should eat right away. Who knows when the food for everyone else will arrive. Multiple times my food comes out late and I always tell people to eat. It's a god damn waste to wait and let your food go cold that you paid good money for. We had a lunch for my coworker and everyone but one person's meal came out. So people just let their food sit, waiting for the last dish to come out. Some people were picking at their fries but never started on their burgers. What is the point of that??? Fucking madness..

At a Friendsgiving we had 20+ people at my place, buffet style. People in front got their food and wanted to wait for everyone and say grace or some shit. I told them, ""please don't, I'd prefer you enjoy your food now"". It took 30 minutes until I got my plate. Why wait that long just to say some words? The fact that everyone showed up and is enjoying each other's company is enough.

Having dinner with friends at my place, my guests get their food first and I always make a point to let them know they can eat right away. Why? Because maybe I am finishing up cleaning a dish or getting something for my dogs. You never know what might come up. It's never too long and it's enjoyable to see my guests enjoying their food.

It's impolite to prevent someone from eating their food as soon as they receive it.

I think at his age his parents should be encouraging him to be social or physically active, like put up a basketball hoop or something in the house. Or when playtime is over, read him a book or teach him very basic math.

What I'm referring to, is the day Reddit decided it'd be the best idea ever to allow blocked comments to be seen. Even after blocking a user, instead of just removing the comment and comment chain altogether.

This has made me think that Reddit has green lit the very thing it claims to fight against and not promote which is toxicity among it's platforms and to quell community infighting. They're working against their own interests and it's stunning how much they don't care by a swift action.

"Most people, including one's closest friends, will abandon them eventually","Let me start off by saying that everyone is self-serving as a technicality, and a person helping someone else is also helping themselves if they felt good about it. There is nothing wrong about that. The only topics are the strength of one's empathy, it's ability to maintain itself and the other forms of self-serving emotions

The most obvious thing that betrays empathy is belief. Stereotypes, biases, discriminations and religious beliefs are infamous killers of empathy and love. The supposedly unbreakable bond of family, close friends and lovers can be broken easily with the appearance of a trait, mental disorder, presentation and orientation that is stereotyped. This has been the case for centuries, probably the beginning of civilisation. The fact that it took more than thousands of centuries for people to begin accepting such things is very telling


I believe that in the right conditions, everyone will betray or abandon the people they love. In the end, people only trust and help others because they are too weak to break the chains of empathy. If it did not feel good to help others, they would have followed another self-serving emotion and achieved something for themselves. But that example pales in comparison to the pathetic minds of humans which are easily twisted by biases and stereotypes. The minds which believes in movies, fairy tales, the words of strangers, religions and more over the words of their loved ones

You can judge a book by its cover,"Alright so does anyone else remember being taught the phrase ‚ÄúWell you can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover,‚Äù in middle, or elementary school? Or just even at a young age?

Well. We have been lied toüòÇ

Yes, we shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äújudge‚Äù people, but to a certain degree, everyone judges everyone, and that isn‚Äôt really a bad thing. Let me explain: If you see someone at a Led Zeppelin Concert, they *probably* like Led Zeppelin. By acknowledging that fact in your head, you, by definition, are judging them. That‚Äôs not bad it‚Äôs just called being observant and making educated guessesüòÇ Maybe they don‚Äôt like Led Zeppelin, but it‚Äôs called an educated guess for a reason, you can‚Äôt be blamed for acknowledging the most probable solution.

Like, if I see a book called, ‚ÄúA History of Vampires,‚Äù it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that the book is, to some degree, about vampires.

I list all these examples to bring you this point:

I saw this post a while back of a women wearing, well, very little clothing and she was standing next to a well dressed man. The man was like ‚ÄúDress more decent,‚Äù and the womens reply was ‚Äúhave decent thoughts.‚Äù

And I took that personally. 

Now, obviously if a women dresses slutty, they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúasking for it.‚Äù But if a women is dressed slutty, it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that, like the book, they are projecting their personality with it. If ya dress slutty, then you‚Äôve probably, at some point, acted sluttyüòÇ This doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs asking for it, but it does project the type of person you are *to a degree.* 

If the guy is well dressed, it‚Äôs probably safe to assume that he has, well, a nice job that requires him to dress nicely. This doesn‚Äôt make him a good person, it just helps project the type of individual you are. This doesn‚Äôt mean that the women in this scenario *isnt* successful, but if you both walk out in public, who are you more likely to believe to be successful? A person who looks like she has low morals or the person who looks like they have high morals? 

This isn‚Äôt an exact science of course, but I don‚Äôt think we should discount what we can see. If you see someone with a Legend of Zelda necklace, they *probably* like The Legend of Zelda. It‚Äôs called an educated guess. 

If someone walks around with a Pornhub shirt, they‚Äôve probably been watching Porn on PornhubüòÇ what you do, say, and wear is a reflection of who you are. It‚Äôs not exact, but it represents what kind of person you are. If you wear a Eric Clapton Shirt, you probably like Rock, specifically Eric Clapton. I

"Adopted/Donor concieved children are not ""ungrateful to their real parents"" for wanting to find their biological family.","Just to be clear. True family is the one who raised you, and I am not saying that bilogical parents have some sort of ""special"" bond to the child. That is not the point. 

It is perfecly normal for someone to want to know where they come from, what kind of medical or even social history their ancestors have had, and what culture they are connected to. Now the only information in this that is absolutely necessary in the technical sense is the medical history, but even so, all the other factors of curiousity are STILL valid reasons to want to know about your biological heritage, and I am tired of people dismissing this. 

Reddit in particular seems to have a hard on for telling adoptees that they should shut up and be grateful they weren't left to rot in a dumpster or in the foster care system, or telling donor concieved kids that the donor has a ""right to privacy"" (if you can't handle the possibility that your genetic offspring will one day want to know about you, even for something as simple as medical records, you should not be donating).

News flash, adoptees didn't choose to be born and do not owe gratitude for their life any more than biological kids owe their parents for basic necessoties like food and shelter. They had no control over their circumstances, and holding the fact that they could have been traumatized by foster systems over their head to guilt them out of looking into their biological history is ridiculous. 

Same goes for donor kids. ""Privacy"" is a weird thing to demand when you are bringing a kid into the world. This is not a game, it's a person with real opinins and emotions who was not able to consent to the terms they were born under. Most countries outside of the US have agreed that anonymity is not a realistic demand for these kinds of procedures, and the donor system in the US is so fucked up that several donor kids have up to 20 siblings. This is not the field you should demand privacy in. 

Last point: people assume just because a kid was adopted, the parents are automatically loving and treat the kid well. I have seen several instances of this assumption being dangerous, because they can be just as abusive as bio parents, but people just assume they're all these good people who can do no wrong and selflessly adopted this poor child with only the child's wellbeing in mind. It's never that black and white, and adoptive parents have just as many variables as bio ones.

I am not saying that it'd be okay for the adopted/donor kid to completely ditch their real family that raised them just because they are biologically related to someone else, but in most cases, if the parents in question treat the child well and are up front about what they know about the child's genetic history, the chances that the kid will ever cut contact is extremely low.",unpopularopinion,1646140267

Entering the friendzone is always a voluntary process for a guy, and you can leave at any point.

For example

1. You‚Äôre on a first date from tinder, you ask her for a second date. But she says that she‚Äôd rather be friends. You can simply (and politely) decline her offer for friendship and part ways amicably.

2. You have a prior acquaintance with a woman (coworker for example) and ask her out for a drink. She prefixes this by saying ‚Äúas friends, right?‚Äù, you can (again politely state) that this was a romantic offer and to avoid complicating the situation you can retract the offer. 

The only situation in which you may want to continue a friendship with a woman (who you may have a romantic interest in) would be if you were friends prior.

Peter Venkman is a creep.,"Sigourney Weaver's character was short changed.

Let me start off by saying - I LOVE the OG ghostbusters and I'm a fan of Bill Murray. But Venkman's sexual harassment of Dana Barrett is so cringe and a Sigourney Weaver character deserves more. 
From the moment they meet, he's trying to sleaze his way into her pants.  ""I'll go to miss Barrett's apartment to check her out"". Snooping through the house. Nothing ever happened in the bedroom? ""what a crime"". ""I'll go for broke, I'm madly in love with you."" ""No kiss?"". In a cut scene, he's also proposing to sleep the night. 
Then when she has become possessed by zuul, the scene where there are clothes strung everywhere and he's whacked her out with thorazine? Did that imply that in the end he couldn't help himself? I dunno, but it never sat right with me, even watching it as a kid.

Then, in GB2, Dana recalls how he was referring to her as the old ball-and-chain, and pretended to fall asleep whenever she spoke about being serious together. But then goes and picks up her freakin baby and is like ""I should have been your daddy"".  Yeah okay, commitment issues but the writing in GB2 compared to GB is so...ugh...
At least in GB1, Dana got some powerful screen time as a possessed vampy zuul who was genuinely scary. 
In GB2, she's a damsel in distress, and has to do the cheap ""I'll take off my shirt"" bathtime scene because 80s. And when she is finally rescued, Venkman gets his kiss in the final scene... why? There wasn't much leading up to it. More like ""hey it's the end. Let's make em kiss!""

GB is one of my all time favorite films, top 5, but seriously? Sigourney Weaver played Ellen fuckin Ripley. Her character deserved better. And Venkman could still have been a great character without being a sexual predator.

Investing in crypto is stupid,"The idea that you should ""invest"" in crypto is, in my opinion, stupid.  The main reason the value of crypto is skyrocketing is because people who have crypto are encouraging others to also buy crypto so their share of crypto increases in value.  For the most part, it is just a variation of a pyramid scheme.

Furthermore, you aren't investing in some meaningful product.  For most of you, all you are doing by buying crypto is hoping the hype will continue so it will increase in value.  Many of crypto's positive values are way overhyped.  It is not as private as you think, unless you are very technologically adept and have taken the proper financial steps, which I doubt most of you take.  Also, it would certainly make for an awful decentralized currency --- there a reason why economists don't call crypto a currency, and it is not because they hate new technology or any silly reason like that. Furthermore (at least with mining bitcoin), it is atrocious for the environment!  While it has it niche uses, for many people, there is very little reason to use crypto over regular currency.  All you are doing by ""investing"" in crypto is helping people who already own crypto get richer with the hopes that you will get richer too.",unpopularopinion,1646121493

The gambling industry should be extensively outlawed and is one of the most toxic and sadistic industries to ever exist.,"Gambling industry [officials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABj7peI_R2M) have publicly came out and admitted that the industry is corrupt and ruthless. They don't care about you. They care about your money. That's it. The [amount](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/?sh=360d30cd677b) of money the industry wracks in every year is mind-boggling. They're literally preying on the vulnerable and gullible, making it seem as though it's a quick, easy way to make a lot of cash, when in reality, the odds of you actually winning, for example, the lottery, are [1 in every \~300,000,000](https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-the-odds-of-winning-the-lottery-3306232). 

By no means is gambling anything new, but I do believe that with 21st century technology, it's made it easier than ever for companies to wrap you around their finger with their flashy, enticing machinery and their fake ""high-baller"" culture that they claim to sport.

I grew up in Las Vegas and have witnessed firsthand people destroying their lives in mere hours, it's ASTONISHING to watch. Even members of my family have been addicted to the intense, luring depths of this sick industry. The casinos will often lack any windows or clocks on purpose, making those inside often lose track of time and spend more of it gambling away their life savings. Fun fact - it's incredibly difficult (or, at least, it was when I lived there) to buy scratch tickets in Vegas because the gambling companies want all of your money to be aimed at the casinos. 

A lot of people will tell themselves, ""Well, no durr, Sherlock. Gambling is clearly one-sided"" until they themselves try it and realize how easy it is to get hooked. I've always thought of gambling as ""financial heroin"" - it's easy to get into the habit, but very difficult to break out of. 

Not only this, but it's completely ruined sports and any sort of competitive challenges. Take horse racing, for example. A [once popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_on_horse_racing) form of entertainment turned into arguably one of the most luring and, quote un-quote ""profitable"" means of betting money. 

The gambling industry is appalling, and the fact that, even after the chaos it brings, it still upholds to the high-end lifestyle it portrays is completely disgusting to me.",unpopularopinion,1646116287

3. When you are fighting, you keep moving around. This makes it very, very difficult to hit in the perfect spot.
4. Let's say you hit the guy in the balls as a first move. This will not make them grab their balls and fall down to the ground and burst out to tears. This hurts like hell and makes them more motivated to beat the shit out of you. They will probably grab their balls for a couple seconds though.

off-roading is an incredibly dumb sport,"Firstly, walking off road works better in practically every situation.

In every other sport where you use something like a horse or a car, its there to extend your capabilities- not handicap you.

Secondly, off roading courses are even dumber- there are no 'wild' situations that resemble them. Who in their right mind would take all the care to take out a path of a couple metres of trees for miles and miles, but not bother to do the final 5% create a surface that somebody could tackle in a regular vehicle. The entire challenge is artificial because forests are no place for cars.

Thirdly, as a sport it seems absolutely no fun to worry about damaging thousands of dollars of equipment, or winching your vehicle out of some ditch they added just to make it harder.

I understand for lots of situations its a nessecary evil, but why people go through all the effort to do it for fun I'll never understand.",unpopularopinion,1646108790

"The world would be better if people didn't try to ""help"" others to feel better about themselves","(This got too long, so TLDR: It's fine to give advice to other people and share your experiences, but as soon as someone tells you that they're not going to follow your advice because it doesn't fit them, the only right thing to do is to shut up, accept it and move on. Anything else is trying to push your own ideas of what's right unto others, and/or trying to feel like a good person at the expense of other people's lives.)

I'm 30, and during all my life I met people who tried to have a say in my choices just because they felt that I would be better if I followed their advice. In every respect: the way I eat, the way I sleep, my jobs, my interests, the languages I'd like to learn, my sexuality, my social life, you name it. Of course I'm fine with advice, because I know it's done out of genuine love and concern, which I'm thankful for. I'm also fine with trying whatever they say to see if it works for me. However, many times people expect you to follow their advice even if you can't/don't want to at the moment (getting resentful or pestering/harassing you until you do what they say, and considering that your reasons are just excuses), or they go so far as to act upon your life without your consent (*and* after that, they expect you to be grateful for them messing with your life). Only when I cut ties with certain people, or stopped talking about my life with them, I could actually make my own choices more freely and dramatically improve my life.

I've tried talking about this with some of these people, but they seem to be so fundamentally offended at the idea of them not knowing what's better for other people, and their experiences not being universal experiences, that it really starts to feel as if they didn't care at all for other people, and they were doing it for their own ego boost all along. Either because they genuinely believe that they are the standard for what other people are supposed to be, or because they want to feel like a hero in other people's lives (or both). In the best case, they just treat anybody who thinks different as some misguided soul and hope them to get on the ""right track"".

Now I see all the time younger people being treated the same way and doubting themselves because of these situations, and it's bugging me to think that it's such an accepted thing to do, and that they might need to do the work I did for myself just because of unnecessary remarks by people who want to feel important.

I find this behaviour really common (this is why I post it here), and I think it does significantly more damage than whatever good it could bring. So that, I think that if people just shut up and kept them to themselves once and for all as soon as someone says ""thanks but no, I'm good"", we would have better relationships and be healthier overall.",unpopularopinion,1646108217

I like muffins though even though they're similar to cake for some reason. I haven't had a crumb from any of my cakes for my last four birthdays I hate it so much (I know because I keep track!)

Dissonance in music can be better than harmonies,"So I fell down a rabbit hole of watching duets of Sarah Cothrans cover of As The World Caves In, and I saw one that a lot of people flamed for being dissonant.

I then later stumbled upon this one https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdS3GsLC/

Again, super dissonant, but paints an interesting story, and the crunchiness of it almost complements it for the tone of the song. 

Now let‚Äôs talk about Charles Ives. As a bit of background he was an insurance salesman in Concord, Massachusetts in the late 1800. He just so happened to live next to a lot of the early famous American writers like Hawthorne and The Alcotts. He would proceed to write a piano sonata about his neighbors. The Alcotts (One of them was the the author of little women) had a house with 4 young daughters and a piano in it. In the Alcotts he uses dissonance to show the chaos of what he could hear from that house. Again, painting a story. 

Link to the Alcotts here: https://open.spotify.com/track/4rGzO5Kx0wQLKBeaed1oP7?si=PElQhKejTV-Ea5bxUBYYVQ

"American bacon kinda gross, Canadian bacon (or any back bacon) is so much better","As an American, I think American bacon (the uncooked stuff, not the microwave bacon) is often times gross. It CAN be good, but to make it good the meat shouldn‚Äôt be too crispy, while the fat is the perfect amount of crisp. Often times, American bacon is either not crispy enough, too crispy, or there‚Äôs no equal balance between crisp and not too crisp. It can be good, but it can be hard to get right. Also, way too greasy when you do get it right. Doesn‚Äôt taste that great half the time either. It doesn‚Äôt have much of a depth to it‚Äôs flavor. And it‚Äôs kinda unhealthy.

Now CANADIAN BACON. You cannot cook Canadian bacon incorrectly. The stuff I‚Äôve had is pre cooked, and you need to be an idiot to get it completely wrong. It‚Äôs like ham, but thicker, and has a different taste. It‚Äôs less greasy, and it tastes better. American belly bacon tastes too greasy, too fatty. Canadian back bacon tastes like the pig. It‚Äôs beautiful, it‚Äôs Smokey, and sometimes even a bit sweet, depending on what you eat it with. It has its own flavor, but fits with other flavors so much better. You also don‚Äôt get greasy fingers when you pick it up. It gives a superior breakfast experience.

"People who don‚Äôt believe in magic, and criticize others for practicing it are so are fucking lame.","First off, I‚Äôd like to start by saying if you don‚Äôt believe in magic of any sorts. That‚Äôs fine by me, and I can respect people using their critical thinking skills, to come to their own conclusion. I love science, and any magic or practice that claims to be a better alternative to modern medicine is very harmful.

Second off I‚Äôd like to express this post only applies to those who are like ‚ÄúMagic isn‚Äôt real, how could you be so gullible?‚Äù Atheists and skeptics are all good in my book, just don‚Äôt be a butthole about it.

Now hear are my points as to why people like that are lame‚Ä¶

1. Believing in magic is fucking awesome! It makes life so damn interesting when I can chalk up unexplainable events in my life as spiritual instances, or magical phenomenons.

2. Magic helps me heal that inner child! It heightens my curiosity, and makes the world more interesting. I can cast some Norse symbols for guidance. And If something of mine goes missing, I get to assume an invisible elf or troll must‚Äôve hid it to mess with me(I probably lost it myself, but entertaining the possibility makes the irritating inconvenience an adventure!).

3. People seem to assume Tik Tok witches, crystal girls, and people who use astrology in a toxic way are the default. I can assure you they are not. From my personal experience, folks who practice any sort of magic tend to be pretty chill and down to earth. Every group has their bad apples of course, and the dumbest people can have some pretty loud voices. This doesn‚Äôt mean the community they claim to represent is bad(there are a few exceptions of course).

4. When you‚Äôre so stuck up, that you constantly judge and belittle other people for their beliefs, it makes you look bored and lonely. Like do you not have anything better to do? Sheesh, get a fucking life bud. While you‚Äôre sitting there lecturing me, I‚Äôm just staring into the sun(not recommended) and wondering if I should worship it for it‚Äôs warmth.

But there, that‚Äôs my little rant. If I have any more points to make I‚Äôll do some edits. But for now I‚Äôm gonna have a few drinks, play some video games, and call my lovely shield maiden.

I believe we are on the wrong side of history.,"Trudeau used the same tactic as the Nazi Regime used in 1933 to enact emergency powers to slowly crush opposition/dissent.

That is called ""projection"", anyone who has had a loved one cheat on them know its very basic psychological behavior. The trucker protest was akin to the Reichstag Fire, which lead to the Nazi regime implementing emergency measures bypassing normal governmental procedure and the ability to violate human rights, etc. 

Trudeau, the leader of Canada, used Nazi tactics. The City of London bankers funded the Nazi side of WW2, and they exist today still, with Klaus being the head it seems, which means that the New World Order will never exist, they want a Nazi World Order.

"A lot of people who say they're ""shy"" are actually just really boring people.","Not saying ALL people who say this are like that, but just a good number of folks I meet who say they're shy end up not having very many interests, no games they play, no hobbies, no interest in most entertainment and media, no ambitions or goals, no interesting means of communication or holding conversation, little to no sense of humor, just... bland.

Pizza is an overrated food,"For context, I am American--so I'm talking about American-style pizza--and I live in New York City, where it's incredibly oversaturated because there's a pizza place on every single block.

I think pizza is just *fine*, but everyone always seems to have a meltdown over it and in my opinion it's not nearly good enough to warrant the hype. I've absolutely had good pizza before so that's not the issue; it's just that I'm sooo sick of everyone thinking pizza is the best food in the world when it's really not. I imagine it's partly because loving pizza has become a personality trait to the point that it's pretty much a meme?

For more context, I am a HUGE carb lover, cheese lover, and food lover in general, so it's not as if I don't like the ingredients and/or I'm not super into food.

"Marching band, drum corps, and winter guard/percussion/brass are all sports.","Every time I say something like this so someone who‚Äôs not involved in the marching arts, they look at me like I have three heads. That‚Äôs because they‚Äôve never experienced a typical season of marching.

The marching arts require its participants to put their blood, sweat, and tears into a particular activity for months at a time. Be it in the sweltering sun, pouring rain, sudden cold, or even indoors, you‚Äôre running around on a football field or gym floor for anywhere from 5-13 minutes with immaculate technique that requires the best possible posture.

No matter what section you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre carrying equipment that‚Äôs a lot heavier than it looks. Snare drum? That‚Äôs 20-25 pounds. Trumpet? 5-10 pounds. Tuba? You‚Äôre looking at anywhere from 25-45 pounds. Even colorguard equipment such as flags and rifles are heavier than items a typical person would interact with on a daily basis.

Your heart rate is much faster than normal, often reaching 180 bpm and higher, and you‚Äôre taking in hundreds of gallons of oxygen per minute, and that‚Äôs with a good two hours of breathing exercises and other forms of respiratory preparation.

And your ensemble‚Äôs performance is judged by a panel of experts against several other performances, with the placing announced at the end of the event. And it gets extremely competitive, sometimes to the point where entire audiences will ‚Äòboo‚Äô for a bad call.

Rinse and repeat for a solid two months of performances, and that‚Äôs your typical season of marching. Oh, and don‚Äôt forget the months of incessant hydration, exercise, and long rehearsals it actually takes to learn, improve, and perfect everything you do. More effort is put into the marching arts than a lot of sports out there, and yet people don‚Äôt consider it a sport. Hmmm‚Ä¶

"Friends should not be obligated to text, call, or spend the same quality time with you compared to an earlier stage in your friendship","Just because you had a really great friend that you hung out with all the time with and shared a close bond with doesn't make that friend obligated to have the same relationship with you forever. It doesn't mean your friend doesn't care about you any less, but you will inevitably become less of a priority to them. 

Your friend may have grown as a person and found more interesting people to spend free time with.  You friend may have gotten a new job, going to college, found some new hobbies, or found a spouse that they will one day marry and start a family with.  Maybe that friend just has so much responsibilities now, that any free time they have they just want to relax solo without being on their phone or hanging out with friends. 

It's not your friend's responsibility to fill your life with entertainment and companionship. That's completely on you to find hobbies, social groups, a career that you absolutely love, and a loving spouse to spend time with. 

There are situations in life where a friend does need to be there for you in a time of need such as going through a breakup, losing a loved one, or losing your job.  But a friend doesn't need to be there for you if you make bad decisions or have self inflicted drama.  

Just because your friend was a fun single drinking buddy in your early 20s, doesn't mean your friend can't put that lifestyle behind them.

If you found a job where you work from home and never leave the house, your friend isn't obligated to step in to fulfill your social needs.

I'm not saying it's fine for your friend to just fall off the map and never have communication with you.  But it's perfectly reasonable for a friendship to gravitate to where you hangout in person a few times a year or catch-up on a phone call once a month or longer.  Life just happens. 

I was bummed in my mid-20s where my friends who I went out with every weekend got girlfriends and then I rarely saw them.  At the time I thought they were terrible friends.  Looking back on it, my friends were growing as people while I was just the single guy that was still living like I was in college going to the bars and clubs every weekend.  Once I got older and got into long term relationships, had more life responsibilities, found new hobbies, and working toward some long term goals, I realize communicating and hanging out with friends is just something that slowly went to the back burner.  I love my friends.  But I just don't have time to small talk about nothing or keeping up with friends that haven't had any growth the last 2 years with anything in their life. If I can predict exactly how a text conversation will go if I ask them about what they've been up to, then it's just not a priority to reach out to them.",unpopularopinion,1646096265

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was not *that* bad,"TL;DR it wasn‚Äôt great, but it didn‚Äôt suck THAT hard.

With all the buzz around Indy 5 wrapping filming, I‚Äôm hearing all the old criticisms of Indy 4 resurface. And while it certainly had its problems, I don‚Äôt think it deserves as much hate as it gets. IMO it‚Äôs better than Indy 2. Though that‚Äôs not saying much. 

Criticisms I agree with: it had way too much CGI, the alien stuff was a little hokey, the set design was often lazy, Cate Blanchett‚Äôs Russian accent was ridiculous, and the character of Mudd was out of place and poorly written. 

However, I loved the final message of the film, that wisdom is a greater treasure than any material thing. I liked the return of Marion, and a more mature Indy ending his cliched womanizing ways, and settling down with someone who is 1) largely age appropriate and 2) not a shrieking damsel in distress, and ultimately trying to be a good father. I also liked the idea of passing the mantle to a new generation. Ford isn‚Äôt getting any younger, and Shia is a really great actor who unfortunately made a lot of bad decisions. If the movie had better screenplay writers I think he could have given us a very compelling character. 

Am I optimistic for Indy 5? No. Lucasfilm is probably going to bend over backwards trying to undo Indy 4, and I‚Äôm not sure Waller Bridges‚Äô style of humor will blend well with the Indiana Jones universe, and Disney/Marvel‚Äôs patented humor-at-gunpoint, which has spilled into every Disney-owned property up until now, will only be a drag on the film.",unpopularopinion,1646094517

Especially when people talk about it like their work is easy! I've only done a few classes in game development and I can at least see that it's an extremely complex task that can span entire years. 

It just really reminds me of those video's you see of people snapping at employees (Karens), people always say they don't mean it like that but they do, cause the company is a representative of the employees, the company itself can't do anything on it's own after all. 

 I can understand wanting to help the process through criticism BUT I think that only works if it's **constructive**, a lot of people *think* they're being constructive but it's really just complaining without the input into how the area of their complaints can actually improve.

Sorry I'm ranting. I just....I feel sad every time I think of it. :(",unpopularopinion,1646093823

"Get a job doing what you love, and you'll grow to hate what you love","As the old saying goes ""Choose a job you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life."" But I think many of us who have followed this wisdom have come to find out that, no, do not mix what you love with your work, or you will grow to hate what you once loved. 

Work does a good job at muddying up things. You might have a boss lording over you dictating what you do, or you might just be overwhelmed with the sheer amount of work and effort. And then there's the constant need to make money, and you'll want to make a lot of it, which is primarily the factor which taints things.

Let's say, for example, that you love to write, and so you pursue a career as a writer. But hold on, you need to actually make enough money to live, and you're going to constantly be comparing the amount you make to what other people make, or what you could make if you went into another field. Now all of a sudden your writing is dictated by your need to make money. And now instead of writing what you want to write about, all of a sudden you're writing what you're \*forced\* to write about, and that's a big difference. Now with all the work load you get so burnt out that you never want to write again. 

Or let's say you love football, and you find a career where you basically watch football and football media all day every day, but there's just so much of it and so much bullshit that goes along with the job that you can't fucking stand football anymore.

Meanwhile, you could have chose a career doing something that sucks and is difficult,  and everyone knows it sucks and is difficult, but you make so much money doing it that you have so much free time that you can spend it doing what you love, without constraints, without anything there to turn your passion into something you dread. 

I think this is a realization a lot of people find out the hard way. They're told since they're little to try to make a career out of what they love, but then they start to hate it and they realize they're better off making more money in a different field and creating that free time to pursue their passion instead of trying to fit that passion into their work. 

I suppose there are some exceptional circumstances where doing what you love as a career works out. Let's say you have total control over what you do and when you do it. Like for the writer example, let's say you can actually make a ton of money writing whatever you actually want to write about, and you're not under a bunch of shitty constraints by a boss or what have you. Obviously, that sometimes happen, but it isn't the norm.

tl;dr:

Separating what you love from your work is a pretty good idea in a lot of cases.",unpopularopinion,1646093150

I feel this sort of satisfaction nailing QTEs maybe because I'm a bit OCD. I think my opinion is unpopular because I've only heard complains about QTE from people and never heard a single person praise it and tbh I was lowkey disappointed that QTEs weren't a thing in new God of War, I expected them in boss fights and I wished more action games used it today.

"""All the other kids are doing it"" is sometimes a valid justification.","And I regret thinking it isn't. 

My daughter is now 30, when she was in highschool everyone had a cell phone so she wanted one, too. 


Our household was always open in communication, and if you wanted something you had to give reason for why you wanted it and it would be discussed and usually after hearing them out we would let them do the thing. 


Usually it was about staying out past their usual curfew, ex: curfew was usually 10 pm but that got extended for prom night. Or a midnight game or book release, curfew would be extended. 


Looking back on the cell phone thing, I regret not accepting my daughter's reasoning. We had a house phone so I figured if her friends wanted to get in touch or make plans 


""All the other kids have one"" just didn't seem like good reasoning to me at the time and I thought it was a waste of money. 


Looking back, not wanting to be left out is a good reason. I realized this when I started getting my nails done because all the other women at my new job get their nails done, and I feel like a huge hypocrite for not realizing earlier on that just wanting to fit in is sometimes a reason enough for wanting something. 


Looking back, their social life was hindered quite a lot because of it. I didn't realize at the time that almost everyone *did* have a cell phone and I was hindering their social life by not allowing one. It wasn't that we couldn't afford it, that's different, I just feel bad about it now in hindsight and realize sometimes it's OK to just want something because everyone else has it.",unpopularopinion,1646089881

This is not to say that you should always be waking up at noon, but waking up really early to avoid being lazy just has more harm than benefit. In fact I'd argue it just ends up making you even less productive, since we all know it's hard to get anything done if you're tired out of your mind.

"Social Media is destroying our society, not connecting it, or bettering it.","I (20M) recently deleted a ton of friends/followers off of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, my main time wasters. I turned off notifications, and removed them from the Home Screen. 

I found that I was spending way too much time looking at other peoples shit that I really didn't care about. I also realized that I spent way too much energy into how many likes, comments, retweets, shares, you name it, I got on my posts. Like if I didn't get my post seen by a specific number of people or a person if it was targeted, I would get stressed out about it. Then I asked myself, how many people out there are like me, and there's definitely people I know who are worse, and their lives revolve around that stuff. 

I think social media and the development of smart phones has wrecked my generation (and the one behind me) because now all we do as kids growing up is face down into the iPad or phone. I can't even fucking go on a date with a girl without her looking at her phone for the damn three hour span we're together. 

A part of me wishes that I lived pre-internet, where you had to go face to face with people, because now anyone does is snapchat each other and I think it is already having major effects on the social skills of my generation. I also believe that waiting to reply to a text or snap because you ""don't want to seem too available"" is FUCKED, but that's another rant. 

After all of this, removing that stress from my life has made me 10 times happier, because I don't have to keep tabs on 400 other people and their particular situations.

Evacuations invite human trafficking,"When massive evacuations are going on, there will sometimes be a white van that has taped the red cross on the side to show people they could get in the van to be taken for medical treatment. 

However these people are not affiliated with the Red Cross in anyway.

In my opinion it is extremely important that the Red Cross logo never be used by anyone unless they are directly affiliated with the Red Cross, even if they think it‚Äôs only to help in an emergency. 

I think this because in mass evacuation situations people need to be able to see that logo and tell if it‚Äôs genuine. When it looks legit they can trust 100% that it is official support, but when it looks off they can be certain that this person is not trying to help and to find another way. 

In mass evacuations like the mass shooting at the Country concert in Las Vegas or the pulse night club, human traffickers will wait on the other side of the emergency and take advantage of the chaos to pose as medical personnel in order to kidnap and force victims into human trafficking. 

TLDR; Using a temporary Red Cross logo to attract evacuees and refugees to vehicles when you‚Äôre not affiliated with the Red Cross is actually more dangerous for refugees because it makes them comfortable going with traffickers that they assume are Red Cross volunteers. Use the green cross instead.",unpopularopinion,1646086019
I believe originality and innovation is heavily overrated in video game discourse,"A very common critique I see of games in places like r/games or r/gaming is that they lack originality or borrow mechanics from other games.

For example, the recent Horizon FW has been critiqued for being a ""Ubisoft style"" game , and Elden Ring has been dismissed as just more soulsborne but open world 

 I find this critiques to lack much meaning, because for me with games what matters far more is how the mechanics of a game are executed, how they compliment the core gameplay loop, and how systems are expanded upon in a way that makes for more satisfyingly gameplay. If there is a mechanic that is really interested or effective, I *want* more devs to steal it and use it in their games. I want more games with a destruction based gameplay loop like Red Faction Guerilla. I want more games with combat that focuses on location based damage and taking apart enemies piece by piece like horizon zero dawn. I want more games with grapple hook and wingsuit based traversal like Just Cause 3. 

 Mechanics are tools, and building upon them through iteration can result in very fun experiences. They should not be replaced or reworked for the sake of it, but only when it will make the actual gameplay experience better. What I think people should focus on is how entertaining a core gameplay loop is, and how the content and scenarios included in the game allow you to engage with this loop in interesting ways, or not

For an example that summarizes my point. The problem with FIFA is not that the gameplay is largely the same every year and you are mainly paying for roster and kit updates. Soccer is inherently a game with 11 dudes playing another 11 dudes on a field, it doesnt need a fps shooter mode or something. Asking to reinvent itself makes no sense. The problem with FIFA is that the gameplay is kinda ass and the modes are underbaked, and that should be the focus of the criticism",unpopularopinion,1646085899
Chairs are designed wrong - the back should be in the front,"If you work an office job, think about yourself sitting all day at some desk chair: What are you doing the whole time you're working? Leaning forward.

The back of the chair is largely only used during breaks or meetings when you aren't engaged with your computer. This leads to terrible posture because your muscles have to overwork to hold your body in a forward position.

The back of the chair, the part you lean on that supports your back, should be in the front. That way you are supported as you lean into your computer and can have a more ergonomic position.",unpopularopinion,1646085807

Only 1 Good Excuse For Cheating,"If you are being abused by your partner(s) go ahead and cheat like no other. 

Literally cannot think of any other valid reasons for cheating. You fell out of love? Break up, divorce. You fell in love with somebody else? Talk to your current partner about polyamory/open relationship. If they say no either give up the new person or break up with your current SO. Not having all your needs met (sexually/romantically/whatever), talk to them about it! Or polyamory or bReAk uP. Seriously, so many problems and so much heartbreak could be prevented or solved by communication, being polyamorous, or by breaking up. Ruining somebody‚Äôs self-confidence is not worth getting laid, get over yourself. If you chase 2 rabbits, both with escape, you must choose.

If you can think of another valid reason to cheat that would not be solved by breaking up or polyamory please let me know.

Using wet toilet paper to wipe is far superior than dry,"Seriously, I've been doing it since I was a child. I fold the toilet paper a few times then pour water on it so that there is a puddle of water in the middle. The toilet paper does not get soggy since it's folded 3 or 4 times. Then, I wipe until there is nothing on the tp.

But wait, I'm not done. After that, I take more wet toilet paper then use my finger to push it about 1 centimeter into my anus then clench and unchench a few times before pulling it out, revealing a small amount of shit still remaining. I have to do this about 7 times until there is nothing left. This would probably be undetectable with dry wiping. 

It takes longer, but its a small price to pay for a clean ass. I seriously have no idea how people wipe with dry toilet paper, doesn't it rip apart or grip onto your ass?

It's all unfortunate.  This and all the Dark Souls games are beautiful with rich lore that a LOT of people won't get to see because they can't make it past the first boss.

It doesn't leave much time to die 30 times in a row trying to get past 1 boss.  I get one hour, maybe 2 at night.  Struggling to get past a single boss isn't how I want to spend my gaming time.

Filling/Recharging from empty once a week, 52 weeks a year. 
ICE : $2,028
Batt: $379

In my unpopular opinion, although the base model 3 is faster (still very sluggish vs the $52k long range non performance model 3 ) the interiors and exteriors of both are OK and nothing overly exciting. They are similar in size. 

It would take you 9+ years of driving, or over 128,000 miles to offset fuel costs by charging ONLY at home for the price of a Model 3. That‚Äôs at minimum, as the Corolla has a 30%+ range. 

Obviously not everyone will drive 128k miles in 9 years.",unpopularopinion,1646072370
People not willing to kill or die for their countries aren't treasoners.,"I've been thinking about this but now since the Ukrainian-Russian conflict got a hell ton of media attention, I guess it's about time to say this.

People who are not willing to murder people just to protect their country or don't want to die as a mere pawn in the world leaders' chess games aren't treasoners, traitors or cowards. They are people who value their one and only lives over a country and it's not a bad thing. It's not a good thing either, it's just a decision of theirs which people respect. They didn't ask to be born in the country everyone wants them to fight till their last breaths for. We can't even know if they liked the country before they got conscripted and forced to fight and die for it. 

It's pointless to condemn people who flee the country before getting conscripted or hide until the war is over.

War is so damn unnecessary.",unpopularopinion,1646072366

I don't respect the law (and neither should you),"That's all you hear about on Reddit. Illegal this, legal that. As if any legal system works, and we should respect it. 

I don't kill people not because it's illegal but because it's a horrible thing to do. 

I don't shoplift because I don't need to. But I have no problem with the poor doing it because they actually need things. 

Yet every minute of every day the public are being robbed blind by the financial industry.

I don't like the fact that SSDs are so much faster than HDD.,"I recently upgraded to an SSD after using only HDD for more than 20 years. 

I miss that 2-3 minutes load time, while booting. I would always do something like drink water, get some other thing done or even think about what to do in the near future.

Now when I'm using SSD my system boots up lightning fast, taking just a few seconds and i get flabbergasted. 

Even when playing games, it loads so fast after i die, sometimes (out of habit) i just stare at the screen, thinking about the changes i need to make in my gameplay while waiting for the checkpoint to reload, with excitement and anticipation only to find out that it was already loaded like after 3-5 seconds after i died. 

Earlier, when i used to die, i used to get 30-40 seconds to plan how to overcome the mistakes i made. Now, as i got used to the quick load time, i don't even get time to make new strategy or think about what mistakes i made and out of force of habit, i always click on continue as soon as the game reloads.",unpopularopinion,1646071477

the sequel trilogy is better than the original trilogy and kylo ren is categorically better and more memorable than darth vader.,"the original trilogy is iconic, but i suspect its about an incredible score and even more incredible bandwagoning. 

darth vader should have never become iconic. he looks cool, but hes boring. he is a puppet of the emperor and he takes orders from a regular human guy. his swordfighting is boring and unimpressive. hes not exciting to watch at all. hes like hanibal lecter, but without the physchology and mind games. he stands and walks and holds him arm up a couple times, and thats about it. from a moviegoing perspective, hes not intimidating. the emperor is actually pretty fun and campy. he actually sort of embraces the good part of the dark side. he gives in to his emotions and his anger and hatred. darth vader is almost as bland as obi wan‚Äôs ‚Äú.. ill become more powerful than you could PoSsIbLy ImAgInE‚Äù ass. he should have just said ‚Äú.. ill send some motivational brain tweets at critical points to fill in some plot and make the story progress.‚Äù 

kylo ren is fun and expressive. sure he‚Äôs a twerp, but he was raised by the saviors of the galaxy, he‚Äôs gonna be a little entitled. its consistent. he also actually has a reason to be angry and abandon the light side. he has regular human fears and emotions and his master/uncle tried to kill him. thats a pretty good reason to see the jedi as bogus! the jedi would usher in a world like equilibrium. even other jedi come to the realization that the jedi order is bogus. that‚Äôs the revelation of the sequal trilogy. it feels like theyre democratizing the use of the force. its more organic. 

im not even bringing up how stupid the prequels make the original trilogy because they make vader‚Äôs motivations pathetic. i also appreciated the dynamic between kylo and rey more than luke and vader. the romance thing was stupid, ill give you that. but the redemption of kylo made more sense and was more satisfying than vader‚Äôs.",unpopularopinion,1646071368

I just stopped for lunch at a fast food joint while out and mentioned it to here...""you should have used the app. I have a free blah blah and I would get double points.""

Man, ok, I get it if you're budgeting and using them for deals and coupons whatever. We aren't in a financial situation where that's necessary. And it's not even always that.

Manifesting is real,"People are not going to believe me because they think it‚Äôs only spiritual and it can‚Äôt be proven. But I wouldn‚Äôt think of it as just spiritual. I garuntee you that philosophers and scientists would back me up on this. 

If you don‚Äôt know what manifesting is, It‚Äôs when you want something in life really bad, but you act like you already have it. The more you do that and convince yourself you have what you want, you will eventually receive whatever it is you want. People have a hard time believing that because they can‚Äôt possibly think it‚Äôs that easy. 

I think of manifesting as a positive state of mind. I mean think about it, all of our lives we are taught to believe in our dreams. The more you believe the more it will eventually be handed to you. There are many stories of how legends and celebrities have manifested their dreams to get to where they are now. For example Ed Sheeren, Halsey, Demi Lovato, etc manifested. And look where they are now. 

Another argument is that we all have Newfie‚Äôs and the universe has frequencies. There‚Äôs a real thing from scientists that‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Law of Attraction.‚Äù The rule is that if you put enough energy and frequency on something with an emotion, you‚Äôre going to attract it. That‚Äôs how the universe works. 

The only reason why manifesting doesn‚Äôt work for you is because you don‚Äôt 100% believe in what you are manifesting. In order to manifest, you can‚Äôt have doubts

Porn is not a bad way of being introduced to sex,"First of all, I think people underestimate just how many people are introduced to sex through porn. We live in the internet age where 13 and 14-year-olds can google anything they want, the inevitably start seeking out sexual material and stumble upon porn. The kids that are introduced to sex through sex-ed before porn are very few. Yet most people have satisfactory sex and know how to use a condom.


&gt;But porn doesn't depict foreplay which is important for good sex


We see foreplay in movies all the time. No one is going to skip it just because they didn't see it in porn.


&gt;But a lot of people think real sex is like professional porn


This is a tiny minority of people that are so naive that they would fall for something stupid eventually. For most people the difference between brazzers and real sex is as obvious as the difference between an action movie and the news. You only have to watch one amateur porn video to know the difference.


I think our culture over complicates sex in general. My grandparents, great-grandparents and all of my ancestors since they were eukaryotes somehow figured out sex without ever seeing sexual imagery and without a teacher explaining to them what the penis and the vagina is. My cat knows how to have sex and he is so stupid that he drinks toilet water. If you know how to use a condom then what else is there to know?",unpopularopinion,1646070383
