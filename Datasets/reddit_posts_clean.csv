"AskScience AMA Series: Molecular engineering (MolE) encompasses everything from protein design, nanomaterials, vaccine development, battery/solar cell design, &amp; much more. We're a group of students, professors &amp; staff connected to the University of Washington's MolE Institute. AUA about MolE!","We are graduate students, staff, and faculty from the University of Washington Molecular Engineering and Science (MolES) Institute. Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though MolES only opened in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!

Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the object-level behavior of something by precisely altering it on the molecular level - given knowledge of how molecules in that ""something"" interacts with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are endless! Some specific examples of Molecular Engineering research being done within the labs of the MolES Institute are:

1. MolES faculty member and Chemistry professor Al Nelson developed a new way to produce medicines and chemicals and preserve them in portable, modular ""biofactories"" embedded in water-based gels known as hydrogels. This approach could enable access to critical medicines and other compounds in low-resource areas.
2. The Baker lab in MolES and Biochemistry is engineering artificial proteins to self-assemble on a crystal surface. The ability to program these interactions could enable the design of new biomimetic materials with customized chemical reactivity or mechanical properties, that can serve as scaffolds for nano-filters, solar cells or electronic circuits.
3. Bioengineering/MolES Institute Professor Kelly Stevens developed a new 3D printing approach to create biocompatible hydrogels with life-like vasculature - opening the possibility of printing living human tissue for things like organ replacement!
4. Researchers in MolES and Chemical Engineering professor Elizabeth Nance's lab are attempting to deliver therapeutics to the brain using tiny nanoparticles that can effectively cross the blood-brain-barrier in brain injury and disease.
5. MolES PhD student Jason Fontana is working in the labs of James Carothers and Jesse Zalatan to develop tools that facilitate genetic engineering in bacteria for optimizing biosynthesis of valuable products.

Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to further general awareness of our discipline!

Modern propaganda is far more dangerous than it used to be,"Propaganda has been a staple in geopolitics for a long time. 

It's nothing new to shape the public opinion and the idea of doing so may even be necessary.

However - today's propaganda is much different from what it was even just 30 years ago. 

Propaganda today is swift, organized, and more importantly easily concealed and distributed for consumption.

[It was illegal for the Pentagon to produce propaganda targeted at the American populace until 2013](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/)

Now cheap venues such as Netflix, which is affordable to most, can be used as mouthpieces for propaganda. Entire shows can be produced by the Pentagon and you will have no idea.

We have moved past [traditional means](https://imgur.com/a/j2TObzx) and moved into grey territory.

Propaganda can now affect you without being obvious about it. Your main character you root for in a show can be written in a way that you now sympathize with something you may not have before. 

Astroturfing and trolling have also reached points where forums such as Reddit have become nearly unviable.

Drinking alone isn't really that bad,"I don't agree with the belief that drinking alone is a sign of alcoholism. I also eat hamburgers alone, but I'm not at risk of being a burger fiend.

- Drinking to *self medicate*/*escape*/*sad*
- Always needing to drink to have fun
- Drinking when pressured
- Spending a lot on liquor

Sometimes mfs just want to relax at home with some alcohol. It doesn't need to be a social event to be ""ok"".

"The US legal immigration system, which is outdated, flawed and backlogged, should be fixed before giving illegal immigrants a pathway to citizenship.","There are many immigrants waiting for there applications to be processed, some have lost their jobs, some have been forced to leave the country, some can't see their family, some kids who legally grew up here having to self-deport and some have to wait decades. The general US population doesn't know about this and it's rarely talked about. If it's not talked about, no one is going to so anything.

Leonardo DiCaprio is not an amazing actor...,"The praise and the Oscar he got for The Revenant was justified. The people who say that he deserved more Oscars for his other movies, I fully disagree.

What's the point of researching anything is everyone you care about would be dead by the time they could actually recieve the treatment due to such strict regulations?

Many advocates in my opinion are either hypocrites and if they aren't they're flat out demented. If someone were to seriously harm your young child or younger sibling you would have no reserves regarding what happened to the perpetrator. In fact. You would likely wish the worst for them. Yet if the victim of a violent crime is any other stranger. Especially if they arent a woman or child. Suddenly prison reform matters to you and you care how the perpetrator is treated.

Granted, the legal system is flawed and always will be to some extent. So I think this punishment should only be on the table, when the case is pretty open and shut with just about undisputable evidence. 

People will say otherwise but there's a clear difference when it comes to catching a criminal as they're committing an act with cameras and witnesses all around and hunting down someone and relying primarily on witness testimony alone. If every case was as cut and dry, there would be little to no need for interrogators. So experimentation should only be applied to prisoners who have absolutely no realistic way of claiming innocence.",unpopularopinion,1646160964,1,"Violent criminals should be used for human experimentationPrison reform advocates say that death penalties and long sentences don't help anyone.

"The ""SuperStonk""/GME craze is cult-like and prays on the novice retail investor","Everyone in r/SuperStonk hypes up GME like it is guaranteed to increase 1000x in the near future. It's fine to form a hypothesis and believe it in, but these people are making unrealistic promises to low-income, retail investors in order to pump the stock. GME appeals to novice investors specifically, because simply dumping all your money into a single stock that is ""clearly going to the moon"" is a lot quicker and much less effort than building a three-fund portfolio with relatively low-risk index funds which will reliably yield growth over decades.

At the end of the day, we *cannot* say with any real degree of certainty what the future trend is going to be for GME. If the stock was practically guaranteed to become more valuable, its current price would already reflect that increase. There are organizations who pay millions of dollars to some of the smartest people alive to make stock picks, it is arrogant to assume you know something they don't.

I'm writing this post because I feel uneasy when I see someone with very little savings being encouraged to dump all of it into a single stock. To me, it comes off as a fervent bid to realize the gains they want to see by peer pressuring everybody else to buy in and hold. I just worry that the end result is going to be a considerable number of low-income retail investors losing relatively catastrophic amounts of money which they cannot afford to lose once the hype dies off.",unpopularopinion,1646160500,1,"The ""SuperStonk""/GME craze is cult-like and prays on the novice retail investorEveryone in r/SuperStonk hypes up GME like it is guaranteed to increase 1000x in the near future.

People are better with wet hair and bodies,"Especially guys!! Wet hair is darker and shinier, it also gives off the feeling of cleanliness and is associated with soap.

You're being impolite if you expect others to wait to eat until you get your food.,"It doesn't matter where or when.

If the food at the restaurant comes out for 5/7 people in the group, those people can and should eat right away. Who knows when the food for everyone else will arrive. Multiple times my food comes out late and I always tell people to eat. It's a god damn waste to wait and let your food go cold that you paid good money for. We had a lunch for my coworker and everyone but one person's meal came out. So people just let their food sit, waiting for the last dish to come out. Some people were picking at their fries but never started on their burgers. What is the point of that??? Fucking madness..

At a Friendsgiving we had 20+ people at my place, buffet style. People in front got their food and wanted to wait for everyone and say grace or some shit. I told them, ""please don't, I'd prefer you enjoy your food now"". It took 30 minutes until I got my plate. Why wait that long just to say some words? The fact that everyone showed up and is enjoying each other's company is enough.

Having dinner with friends at my place, my guests get their food first and I always make a point to let them know they can eat right away. Why? Because maybe I am finishing up cleaning a dish or getting something for my dogs. You never know what might come up. It's never too long and it's enjoyable to see my guests enjoying their food.

It's impolite to prevent someone from eating their food as soon as they receive it.

I think at his age his parents should be encouraging him to be social or physically active, like put up a basketball hoop or something in the house. Or when playtime is over, read him a book or teach him very basic math.

"Most people, including one's closest friends, will abandon them eventually","Let me start off by saying that everyone is self-serving as a technicality, and a person helping someone else is also helping themselves if they felt good about it. There is nothing wrong about that. The only topics are the strength of one's empathy, it's ability to maintain itself and the other forms of self-serving emotions

The most obvious thing that betrays empathy is belief. Stereotypes, biases, discriminations and religious beliefs are infamous killers of empathy and love. The supposedly unbreakable bond of family, close friends and lovers can be broken easily with the appearance of a trait, mental disorder, presentation and orientation that is stereotyped. This has been the case for centuries, probably the beginning of civilisation. The fact that it took more than thousands of centuries for people to begin accepting such things is very telling


I believe that in the right conditions, everyone will betray or abandon the people they love. In the end, people only trust and help others because they are too weak to break the chains of empathy. If it did not feel good to help others, they would have followed another self-serving emotion and achieved something for themselves.

You can judge a book by its cover,"Alright so does anyone else remember being taught the phrase “Well you can’t judge a book by its cover,” in middle, or elementary school? Or just even at a young age?

Well. We have been lied to😂

Yes, we shouldn’t “judge” people, but to a certain degree, everyone judges everyone, and that isn’t really a bad thing. Let me explain: If you see someone at a Led Zeppelin Concert, they *probably* like Led Zeppelin. By acknowledging that fact in your head, you, by definition, are judging them. That’s not bad it’s just called being observant and making educated guesses😂 Maybe they don’t like Led Zeppelin, but it’s called an educated guess for a reason, you can’t be blamed for acknowledging the most probable solution.

Like, if I see a book called, “A History of Vampires,” it’s probably safe to assume that the book is, to some degree, about vampires.

I list all these examples to bring you this point:

I saw this post a while back of a women wearing, well, very little clothing and she was standing next to a well dressed man. The man was like “Dress more decent,” and the womens reply was “have decent thoughts.”

And I took that personally. 

Now, obviously if a women dresses slutty, they aren’t “asking for it.” But if a women is dressed slutty, it’s probably safe to assume that, like the book, they are projecting their personality with it. If ya dress slutty, then you’ve probably, at some point, acted slutty😂 This doesn’t mean she’s asking for it, but it does project the type of person you are *to a degree.* 

If the guy is well dressed, it’s probably safe to assume that he has, well, a nice job that requires him to dress nicely. This doesn’t make him a good person, it just helps project the type of individual you are. This doesn’t mean that the women in this scenario *isnt* successful, but if you both walk out in public, who are you more likely to believe to be successful? A person who looks like she has low morals or the person who looks like they have high morals? 

This isn’t an exact science of course, but I don’t think we should discount what we can see. If you see someone with a Legend of Zelda necklace, they *probably* like The Legend of Zelda. It’s called an educated guess. 

If someone walks around with a Pornhub shirt, they’ve probably been watching Porn on Pornhub😂 what you do, say, and wear is a reflection of who you are. It’s not exact, but it represents what kind of person you are. If you wear a Eric Clapton Shirt, you probably like Rock, specifically Eric Clapton. I

"Adopted/Donor concieved children are not ""ungrateful to their real parents"" for wanting to find their biological family.","Just to be clear. True family is the one who raised you, and I am not saying that bilogical parents have some sort of ""special"" bond to the child. That is not the point. 

It is perfecly normal for someone to want to know where they come from, what kind of medical or even social history their ancestors have had, and what culture they are connected to. Now the only information in this that is absolutely necessary in the technical sense is the medical history, but even so, all the other factors of curiousity are STILL valid reasons to want to know about your biological heritage, and I am tired of people dismissing this. 

Reddit in particular seems to have a hard on for telling adoptees that they should shut up and be grateful they weren't left to rot in a dumpster or in the foster care system, or telling donor concieved kids that the donor has a ""right to privacy"" (if you can't handle the possibility that your genetic offspring will one day want to know about you, even for something as simple as medical records, you should not be donating).

News flash, adoptees didn't choose to be born and do not owe gratitude for their life any more than biological kids owe their parents for basic necessoties like food and shelter. They had no control over their circumstances, and holding the fact that they could have been traumatized by foster systems over their head to guilt them out of looking into their biological history is ridiculous. 

Same goes for donor kids. ""Privacy"" is a weird thing to demand when you are bringing a kid into the world. This is not a game, it's a person with real opinins and emotions who was not able to consent to the terms they were born under. Most countries outside of the US have agreed that anonymity is not a realistic demand for these kinds of procedures, and the donor system in the US is so fucked up that several donor kids have up to 20 siblings. This is not the field you should demand privacy in. 

Last point: people assume just because a kid was adopted, the parents are automatically loving and treat the kid well. I have seen several instances of this assumption being dangerous, because they can be just as abusive as bio parents, but people just assume they're all these good people who can do no wrong and selflessly adopted this poor child with only the child's wellbeing in mind. It's never that black and white, and adoptive parents have just as many variables as bio ones.

I am not saying that it'd be okay for the adopted/donor kid to completely ditch their real family that raised them just because they are biologically related to someone else, but in most cases, if the parents in question treat the child well and are up front about what they know about the child's genetic history, the chances that the kid will ever cut contact is extremely low.",unpopularopinion,1646140267,1,"Adopted/Donor concieved children are not ""ungrateful to their real parents"" for wanting to find their biological family.Just to be clear.

Don’t get me wrong, I get scared during horror films but afterwards I’m fine. My ritual everynight is to go to bed with the lights off, watch the film, then off to bed.

Peter Venkman is a creep.,"Sigourney Weaver's character was short changed.

Let me start off by saying - I LOVE the OG ghostbusters and I'm a fan of Bill Murray. But Venkman's sexual harassment of Dana Barrett is so cringe and a Sigourney Weaver character deserves more. 
From the moment they meet, he's trying to sleaze his way into her pants.  ""I'll go to miss Barrett's apartment to check her out"". Snooping through the house. Nothing ever happened in the bedroom? ""what a crime"". ""I'll go for broke, I'm madly in love with you."" ""No kiss?"". In a cut scene, he's also proposing to sleep the night. 
Then when she has become possessed by zuul, the scene where there are clothes strung everywhere and he's whacked her out with thorazine? Did that imply that in the end he couldn't help himself? I dunno, but it never sat right with me, even watching it as a kid.

Then, in GB2, Dana recalls how he was referring to her as the old ball-and-chain, and pretended to fall asleep whenever she spoke about being serious together. But then goes and picks up her freakin baby and is like ""I should have been your daddy"".  Yeah okay, commitment issues but the writing in GB2 compared to GB is so...ugh...
At least in GB1, Dana got some powerful screen time as a possessed vampy zuul who was genuinely scary. 
In GB2, she's a damsel in distress, and has to do the cheap ""I'll take off my shirt"" bathtime scene because 80s. And when she is finally rescued, Venkman gets his kiss in the final scene... why? There wasn't much leading up to it. More like ""hey it's the end. Let's make em kiss!""

GB is one of my all time favorite films, top 5, but seriously? Sigourney Weaver played Ellen fuckin Ripley. Her character deserved better. And Venkman could still have been a great character without being a sexual predator.

The Wizard of Oz would make a hardecore horror movie.,"The Wizard of Oz is actually one of my favorite movies as is, and is probably the single most iconic movie in history. There's been a few remakes that have seen some success, but none have been a horror version.  

The horror version should set a new benchmark in the horror genre. It should have heavy metal musical theme, be set in the real world, present or past (circa 1912), and be centered around the fact that some woman was killed in a storm by Dorothy's house landing on her and the woman's crazed sister, a powerful witch, seeks lethal vengeance by haunting and killing Dorothy's family and friends. And Dorothy sets out to retaliate with her ravenous dog. But in the end Dorothy may or may not have dreamt it all.

The horror version should set a new benchmark in the horror genre. It should have heavy metal musical theme, be set in the real world, present or past (circa 1912), and be centered around the fact that some woman was killed in a storm by Dorothy's house landing on her and the woman's crazed sister, a powerful witch, seeks lethal vengeance by haunting and killing Dorothy's family and friends. And Dorothy sets out to retaliate with her ravenous dog. But in the end Dorothy may or may not have dreamt it all. 

See my vision?

Cheese stretching out of someone's mouth is gross.,"In some pizza or hot pocket commercials I've seen the actor taking a bite out of the food with cheese stretching out of their mouth. I've had this happen to me by accident in real life and my Sister's Fiancée talked like it was the most delicious looking thing he's seen while I was embarrassed to be seen like that.

Don't get me wrong, I love seeing cheese stretching between two halves of a Hot Pocket or between two slices of pizza, that looks delicious.

Investing in crypto is stupid,"The idea that you should ""invest"" in crypto is, in my opinion, stupid.  The main reason the value of crypto is skyrocketing is because people who have crypto are encouraging others to also buy crypto so their share of crypto increases in value.  For the most part, it is just a variation of a pyramid scheme.

Furthermore, you aren't investing in some meaningful product.  For most of you, all you are doing by buying crypto is hoping the hype will continue so it will increase in value.  Many of crypto's positive values are way overhyped.  It is not as private as you think, unless you are very technologically adept and have taken the proper financial steps, which I doubt most of you take.  Also, it would certainly make for an awful decentralized currency --- there a reason why economists don't call crypto a currency, and it is not because they hate new technology or any silly reason like that. Furthermore (at least with mining bitcoin), it is atrocious for the environment!  While it has it niche uses, for many people, there is very little reason to use crypto over regular currency.

The gambling industry should be extensively outlawed and is one of the most toxic and sadistic industries to ever exist.,"Gambling industry [officials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABj7peI_R2M) have publicly came out and admitted that the industry is corrupt and ruthless. They don't care about you. They care about your money. That's it. The [amount](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/?sh=360d30cd677b) of money the industry wracks in every year is mind-boggling. They're literally preying on the vulnerable and gullible, making it seem as though it's a quick, easy way to make a lot of cash, when in reality, the odds of you actually winning, for example, the lottery, are [1 in every \~300,000,000](https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-the-odds-of-winning-the-lottery-3306232). 

By no means is gambling anything new, but I do believe that with 21st century technology, it's made it easier than ever for companies to wrap you around their finger with their flashy, enticing machinery and their fake ""high-baller"" culture that they claim to sport.

I grew up in Las Vegas and have witnessed firsthand people destroying their lives in mere hours, it's ASTONISHING to watch. Even members of my family have been addicted to the intense, luring depths of this sick industry.

"The world would be better if people didn't try to ""help"" others to feel better about themselves","(This got too long, so TLDR: It's fine to give advice to other people and share your experiences, but as soon as someone tells you that they're not going to follow your advice because it doesn't fit them, the only right thing to do is to shut up, accept it and move on. Anything else is trying to push your own ideas of what's right unto others, and/or trying to feel like a good person at the expense of other people's lives.)

I'm 30, and during all my life I met people who tried to have a say in my choices just because they felt that I would be better if I followed their advice. In every respect: the way I eat, the way I sleep, my jobs, my interests, the languages I'd like to learn, my sexuality, my social life, you name it. Of course I'm fine with advice, because I know it's done out of genuine love and concern, which I'm thankful for. I'm also fine with trying whatever they say to see if it works for me. However, many times people expect you to follow their advice even if you can't/don't want to at the moment (getting resentful or pestering/harassing you until you do what they say, and considering that your reasons are just excuses), or they go so far as to act upon your life without your consent (*and* after that, they expect you to be grateful for them messing with your life). Only when I cut ties with certain people, or stopped talking about my life with them, I could actually make my own choices more freely and dramatically improve my life.

I've tried talking about this with some of these people, but they seem to be so fundamentally offended at the idea of them not knowing what's better for other people, and their experiences not being universal experiences, that it really starts to feel as if they didn't care at all for other people, and they were doing it for their own ego boost all along. Either because they genuinely believe that they are the standard for what other people are supposed to be, or because they want to feel like a hero in other people's lives (or both). In the best case, they just treat anybody who thinks different as some misguided soul and hope them to get on the ""right track"".

Now I see all the time younger people being treated the same way and doubting themselves because of these situations, and it's bugging me to think that it's such an accepted thing to do, and that they might need to do the work I did for myself just because of unnecessary remarks by people who want to feel important.

I find this behaviour really common (this is why I post it here), and I think it does significantly more damage than whatever good it could bring. So that, I think that if people just shut up and kept them to themselves once and for all as soon as someone says ""thanks but no, I'm good"", we would have better relationships and be healthier overall.",unpopularopinion,1646108217,1,"The world would be better if people didn't try to ""help"" others to feel better about themselves(This got too long, so TLDR: It's fine to give advice to other people and share your experiences, but as soon as someone tells you that they're not going to follow your advice because it doesn't fit them, the only right thing to do is to shut up, accept it and move on.

Dissonance in music can be better than harmonies,"So I fell down a rabbit hole of watching duets of Sarah Cothrans cover of As The World Caves In, and I saw one that a lot of people flamed for being dissonant.

I then later stumbled upon this one https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdS3GsLC/

Again, super dissonant, but paints an interesting story, and the crunchiness of it almost complements it for the tone of the song. 

Now let’s talk about Charles Ives. As a bit of background he was an insurance salesman in Concord, Massachusetts in the late 1800. He just so happened to live next to a lot of the early famous American writers like Hawthorne and The Alcotts. He would proceed to write a piano sonata about his neighbors. The Alcotts (One of them was the the author of little women) had a house with 4 young daughters and a piano in it. In the Alcotts he uses dissonance to show the chaos of what he could hear from that house. Again, painting a story.

"American bacon kinda gross, Canadian bacon (or any back bacon) is so much better","As an American, I think American bacon (the uncooked stuff, not the microwave bacon) is often times gross. It CAN be good, but to make it good the meat shouldn’t be too crispy, while the fat is the perfect amount of crisp. Often times, American bacon is either not crispy enough, too crispy, or there’s no equal balance between crisp and not too crisp. It can be good, but it can be hard to get right. Also, way too greasy when you do get it right. Doesn’t taste that great half the time either. It doesn’t have much of a depth to it’s flavor. And it’s kinda unhealthy.

Now CANADIAN BACON. You cannot cook Canadian bacon incorrectly. The stuff I’ve had is pre cooked, and you need to be an idiot to get it completely wrong. It’s like ham, but thicker, and has a different taste. It’s less greasy, and it tastes better. American belly bacon tastes too greasy, too fatty. Canadian back bacon tastes like the pig. It’s beautiful, it’s Smokey, and sometimes even a bit sweet, depending on what you eat it with. It has its own flavor, but fits with other flavors so much better. You also don’t get greasy fingers when you pick it up. It gives a superior breakfast experience.

"People who don’t believe in magic, and criticize others for practicing it are so are fucking lame.","First off, I’d like to start by saying if you don’t believe in magic of any sorts. That’s fine by me, and I can respect people using their critical thinking skills, to come to their own conclusion. I love science, and any magic or practice that claims to be a better alternative to modern medicine is very harmful.

Second off I’d like to express this post only applies to those who are like “Magic isn’t real, how could you be so gullible?” Atheists and skeptics are all good in my book, just don’t be a butthole about it.

Now hear are my points as to why people like that are lame…

1. Believing in magic is fucking awesome! It makes life so damn interesting when I can chalk up unexplainable events in my life as spiritual instances, or magical phenomenons.

2. Magic helps me heal that inner child! It heightens my curiosity, and makes the world more interesting. I can cast some Norse symbols for guidance. And If something of mine goes missing, I get to assume an invisible elf or troll must’ve hid it to mess with me(I probably lost it myself, but entertaining the possibility makes the irritating inconvenience an adventure!).

3. People seem to assume Tik Tok witches, crystal girls, and people who use astrology in a toxic way are the default. I can assure you they are not. From my personal experience, folks who practice any sort of magic tend to be pretty chill and down to earth. Every group has their bad apples of course, and the dumbest people can have some pretty loud voices. This doesn’t mean the community they claim to represent is bad(there are a few exceptions of course).

4. When you’re so stuck up, that you constantly judge and belittle other people for their beliefs, it makes you look bored and lonely. Like do you not have anything better to do? Sheesh, get a fucking life bud. While you’re sitting there lecturing me, I’m just staring into the sun(not recommended) and wondering if I should worship it for it’s warmth.

But there, that’s my little rant. If I have any more points to make I’ll do some edits. But for now I’m gonna have a few drinks, play some video games, and call my lovely shield maiden. And to all you folks who practice any form of magic, good luck to you and may your pillow be nice and cold when you head to bed.",unpopularopinion,1646104285,1,"People who don’t believe in magic, and criticize others for practicing it are so are fucking lame.First off, I’d like to start by saying if you don’t believe in magic of any sorts.

I believe we are on the wrong side of history.,"Trudeau used the same tactic as the Nazi Regime used in 1933 to enact emergency powers to slowly crush opposition/dissent.

That is called ""projection"", anyone who has had a loved one cheat on them know its very basic psychological behavior.

The marching arts require its participants to put their blood, sweat, and tears into a particular activity for months at a time. Be it in the sweltering sun, pouring rain, sudden cold, or even indoors, you’re running around on a football field or gym floor for anywhere from 5-13 minutes with immaculate technique that requires the best possible posture.

No matter what section you’re in, you’re carrying equipment that’s a lot heavier than it looks. Snare drum? That’s 20-25 pounds. Trumpet? 5-10 pounds. Tuba? You’re looking at anywhere from 25-45 pounds. Even colorguard equipment such as flags and rifles are heavier than items a typical person would interact with on a daily basis.

Your heart rate is much faster than normal, often reaching 180 bpm and higher, and you’re taking in hundreds of gallons of oxygen per minute, and that’s with a good two hours of breathing exercises and other forms of respiratory preparation.

And your ensemble’s performance is judged by a panel of experts against several other performances, with the placing announced at the end of the event. And it gets extremely competitive, sometimes to the point where entire audiences will ‘boo’ for a bad call.

Rinse and repeat for a solid two months of performances, and that’s your typical season of marching. Oh, and don’t forget the months of incessant hydration, exercise, and long rehearsals it actually takes to learn, improve, and perfect everything you do. More effort is put into the marching arts than a lot of sports out there, and yet people don’t consider it a sport. Hmmm…

Your friend may have grown as a person and found more interesting people to spend free time with.  You friend may have gotten a new job, going to college, found some new hobbies, or found a spouse that they will one day marry and start a family with.  Maybe that friend just has so much responsibilities now, that any free time they have they just want to relax solo without being on their phone or hanging out with friends. 

It's not your friend's responsibility to fill your life with entertainment and companionship. That's completely on you to find hobbies, social groups, a career that you absolutely love, and a loving spouse to spend time with. 

There are situations in life where a friend does need to be there for you in a time of need such as going through a breakup, losing a loved one, or losing your job.  But a friend doesn't need to be there for you if you make bad decisions or have self inflicted drama.  

Just because your friend was a fun single drinking buddy in your early 20s, doesn't mean your friend can't put that lifestyle behind them.

If you found a job where you work from home and never leave the house, your friend isn't obligated to step in to fulfill your social needs.

I'm not saying it's fine for your friend to just fall off the map and never have communication with you.  But it's perfectly reasonable for a friendship to gravitate to where you hangout in person a few times a year or catch-up on a phone call once a month or longer.  Life just happens. 

I was bummed in my mid-20s where my friends who I went out with every weekend got girlfriends and then I rarely saw them.  At the time I thought they were terrible friends.  Looking back on it, my friends were growing as people while I was just the single guy that was still living like I was in college going to the bars and clubs every weekend.  Once I got older and got into long term relationships, had more life responsibilities, found new hobbies, and working toward some long term goals, I realize communicating and hanging out with friends is just something that slowly went to the back burner.  I love my friends.  But I just don't have time to small talk about nothing or keeping up with friends that haven't had any growth the last 2 years with anything in their life. If I can predict exactly how a text conversation will go if I ask them about what they've been up to, then it's just not a priority to reach out to them.",unpopularopinion,1646096265,1,"Friends should not be obligated to text, call, or spend the same quality time with you compared to an earlier stage in your friendshipJust because you had a really great friend that you hung out with all the time with and shared a close bond with doesn't make that friend obligated to have the same relationship with you forever.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was not *that* bad,"TL;DR it wasn’t great, but it didn’t suck THAT hard.

With all the buzz around Indy 5 wrapping filming, I’m hearing all the old criticisms of Indy 4 resurface. And while it certainly had its problems, I don’t think it deserves as much hate as it gets. IMO it’s better than Indy 2. Though that’s not saying much. 

Criticisms I agree with: it had way too much CGI, the alien stuff was a little hokey, the set design was often lazy, Cate Blanchett’s Russian accent was ridiculous, and the character of Mudd was out of place and poorly written. 

However, I loved the final message of the film, that wisdom is a greater treasure than any material thing. I liked the return of Marion, and a more mature Indy ending his cliched womanizing ways, and settling down with someone who is 1) largely age appropriate and 2) not a shrieking damsel in distress, and ultimately trying to be a good father. I also liked the idea of passing the mantle to a new generation. Ford isn’t getting any younger, and Shia is a really great actor who unfortunately made a lot of bad decisions. If the movie had better screenplay writers I think he could have given us a very compelling character. 

Am I optimistic for Indy 5? No. Lucasfilm is probably going to bend over backwards trying to undo Indy 4, and I’m not sure Waller Bridges’ style of humor will blend well with the Indiana Jones universe, and Disney/Marvel’s patented humor-at-gunpoint, which has spilled into every Disney-owned property up until now, will only be a drag on the film.",unpopularopinion,1646094517,1,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was not *that* badTL;DR it wasn’t great, but it didn’t suck THAT hard.

"Get a job doing what you love, and you'll grow to hate what you love","As the old saying goes ""Choose a job you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life."" But I think many of us who have followed this wisdom have come to find out that, no, do not mix what you love with your work, or you will grow to hate what you once loved. 

Work does a good job at muddying up things. You might have a boss lording over you dictating what you do, or you might just be overwhelmed with the sheer amount of work and effort. And then there's the constant need to make money, and you'll want to make a lot of it, which is primarily the factor which taints things.

Let's say, for example, that you love to write, and so you pursue a career as a writer. But hold on, you need to actually make enough money to live, and you're going to constantly be comparing the amount you make to what other people make, or what you could make if you went into another field. Now all of a sudden your writing is dictated by your need to make money. And now instead of writing what you want to write about, all of a sudden you're writing what you're \*forced\* to write about, and that's a big difference. Now with all the work load you get so burnt out that you never want to write again. 

Or let's say you love football, and you find a career where you basically watch football and football media all day every day, but there's just so much of it and so much bullshit that goes along with the job that you can't fucking stand football anymore.

Meanwhile, you could have chose a career doing something that sucks and is difficult,  and everyone knows it sucks and is difficult, but you make so much money doing it that you have so much free time that you can spend it doing what you love, without constraints, without anything there to turn your passion into something you dread. 

I think this is a realization a lot of people find out the hard way. They're told since they're little to try to make a career out of what they love, but then they start to hate it and they realize they're better off making more money in a different field and creating that free time to pursue their passion instead of trying to fit that passion into their work. 

I suppose there are some exceptional circumstances where doing what you love as a career works out. Let's say you have total control over what you do and when you do it. Like for the writer example, let's say you can actually make a ton of money writing whatever you actually want to write about, and you're not under a bunch of shitty constraints by a boss or what have you. Obviously, that sometimes happen, but it isn't the norm.

tl;dr:

Separating what you love from your work is a pretty good idea in a lot of cases.",unpopularopinion,1646093150,1,"Get a job doing what you love, and you'll grow to hate what you loveAs the old saying goes ""Choose a job you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life.""

And then there's the constant need to make money, and you'll want to make a lot of it, which is primarily the factor which taints things.

Let's say, for example, that you love to write, and so you pursue a career as a writer. But hold on, you need to actually make enough money to live, and you're going to constantly be comparing the amount you make to what other people make, or what you could make if you went into another field. Now all of a sudden your writing is dictated by your need to make money. And now instead of writing what you want to write about, all of a sudden you're writing what you're \*forced\* to write about, and that's a big difference. Now with all the work load you get so burnt out that you never want to write again. 

Or let's say you love football, and you find a career where you basically watch football and football media all day every day, but there's just so much of it and so much bullshit that goes along with the job that you can't fucking stand football anymore.

Meanwhile, you could have chose a career doing something that sucks and is difficult,  and everyone knows it sucks and is difficult, but you make so much money doing it that you have so much free time that you can spend it doing what you love, without constraints, without anything there to turn your passion into something you dread. 

I think this is a realization a lot of people find out the hard way. They're told since they're little to try to make a career out of what they love, but then they start to hate it and they realize they're better off making more money in a different field and creating that free time to pursue their passion instead of trying to fit that passion into their work. 

I suppose there are some exceptional circumstances where doing what you love as a career works out. Let's say you have total control over what you do and when you do it. Like for the writer example, let's say you can actually make a ton of money writing whatever you actually want to write about, and you're not under a bunch of shitty constraints by a boss or what have you. Obviously, that sometimes happen, but it isn't the norm.

tl;dr:

Separating what you love from your work is a pretty good idea in a lot of cases.",525,0.997
Drums just sound like nonsense,"As the title says, drums and drum sets sound like nonsense. In any movie or tv show where they have a drum battle (like the one in The Office U.S), it all sounds the same.

"""All the other kids are doing it"" is sometimes a valid justification.","And I regret thinking it isn't. 

My daughter is now 30, when she was in highschool everyone had a cell phone so she wanted one, too. 


Our household was always open in communication, and if you wanted something you had to give reason for why you wanted it and it would be discussed and usually after hearing them out we would let them do the thing. 


Usually it was about staying out past their usual curfew, ex: curfew was usually 10 pm but that got extended for prom night. Or a midnight game or book release, curfew would be extended. 


Looking back on the cell phone thing, I regret not accepting my daughter's reasoning. We had a house phone so I figured if her friends wanted to get in touch or make plans 


""All the other kids have one"" just didn't seem like good reasoning to me at the time and I thought it was a waste of money.

I realized this when I started getting my nails done because all the other women at my new job get their nails done, and I feel like a huge hypocrite for not realizing earlier on that just wanting to fit in is sometimes a reason enough for wanting something.

"Social Media is destroying our society, not connecting it, or bettering it.","I (20M) recently deleted a ton of friends/followers off of Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, my main time wasters. I turned off notifications, and removed them from the Home Screen. 

I found that I was spending way too much time looking at other peoples shit that I really didn't care about. I also realized that I spent way too much energy into how many likes, comments, retweets, shares, you name it, I got on my posts. Like if I didn't get my post seen by a specific number of people or a person if it was targeted, I would get stressed out about it. Then I asked myself, how many people out there are like me, and there's definitely people I know who are worse, and their lives revolve around that stuff. 

I think social media and the development of smart phones has wrecked my generation (and the one behind me) because now all we do as kids growing up is face down into the iPad or phone. I can't even fucking go on a date with a girl without her looking at her phone for the damn three hour span we're together. 

A part of me wishes that I lived pre-internet, where you had to go face to face with people, because now anyone does is snapchat each other and I think it is already having major effects on the social skills of my generation. I also believe that waiting to reply to a text or snap because you ""don't want to seem too available"" is FUCKED, but that's another rant. 

After all of this, removing that stress from my life has made me 10 times happier, because I don't have to keep tabs on 400 other people and their particular situations. If someone wants to get in touch with me, they can call me, and if they don't want to, then it wasn't really that important to begin with.

Evacuations invite human trafficking,"When massive evacuations are going on, there will sometimes be a white van that has taped the red cross on the side to show people they could get in the van to be taken for medical treatment. 

However these people are not affiliated with the Red Cross in anyway.

In my opinion it is extremely important that the Red Cross logo never be used by anyone unless they are directly affiliated with the Red Cross, even if they think it’s only to help in an emergency. 

I think this because in mass evacuation situations people need to be able to see that logo and tell if it’s genuine. When it looks legit they can trust 100% that it is official support, but when it looks off they can be certain that this person is not trying to help and to find another way. 

In mass evacuations like the mass shooting at the Country concert in Las Vegas or the pulse night club, human traffickers will wait on the other side of the emergency and take advantage of the chaos to pose as medical personnel in order to kidnap and force victims into human trafficking. 

TLDR; Using a temporary Red Cross logo to attract evacuees and refugees to vehicles when you’re not affiliated with the Red Cross is actually more dangerous for refugees because it makes them comfortable going with traffickers that they assume are Red Cross volunteers.

I believe originality and innovation is heavily overrated in video game discourse,"A very common critique I see of games in places like r/games or r/gaming is that they lack originality or borrow mechanics from other games. It is seen as a negative to make a game that is very similar to one that came before, or to not rework elements of your game in iterative sequels. For example, the recent Horizon FW has been critiqued for being a ""Ubisoft style"" game , and Elden Ring has been dismissed as just more soulsborne but open world 

 I find this critiques to lack much meaning, because for me with games what matters far more is how the mechanics of a game are executed, how they compliment the core gameplay loop, and how systems are expanded upon in a way that makes for more satisfyingly gameplay. If there is a mechanic that is really interested or effective, I *want* more devs to steal it and use it in their games. I want more games with a destruction based gameplay loop like Red Faction Guerilla. I want more games with combat that focuses on location based damage and taking apart enemies piece by piece like horizon zero dawn. I want more games with grapple hook and wingsuit based traversal like Just Cause 3. 

 Mechanics are tools, and building upon them through iteration can result in very fun experiences. They should not be replaced or reworked for the sake of it, but only when it will make the actual gameplay experience better. What I think people should focus on is how entertaining a core gameplay loop is, and how the content and scenarios included in the game allow you to engage with this loop in interesting ways, or not

For an example that summarizes my point. The problem with FIFA is not that the gameplay is largely the same every year and you are mainly paying for roster and kit updates. Soccer is inherently a game with 11 dudes playing another 11 dudes on a field, it doesnt need a fps shooter mode or something. Asking to reinvent itself makes no sense. The problem with FIFA is that the gameplay is kinda ass and the modes are underbaked, and that should be the focus of the criticism",unpopularopinion,1646085899,1,"I believe originality and innovation is heavily overrated in video game discourseA very common critique I see of games in places like r/games or r/gaming is that they lack originality or borrow mechanics from other games.

Public punishment should not be praised as much as it is by parents,"My parents were very vocal about how they’d embarrass me and do things like drag me away or yell at me in front of my friends if I “misbehaved” and they would say stuff like “that’s what happens when you misbehave” and tbh it taught me nothing other than shame and to be afraid of being anywhere around my friends with my mom.

Prestige car brands are not a notable brag any more.,"*Sport/super/hyper cars not included*

10 years ago, the idea of driving a German car was considered opulent and exclusive. 20 years ago, the average person wouldn't own a BMW/Audi and considered those that did ""Well off"".

With finance being more readily available, even the top of the range models are attainable for those on lower incomes, which in itself isn't bad at all, however this combined with more businesses offering cars for employees and lots of used cars being turned out at the end of every 3 year deal,  the market has become saturated with high-end cars for not a whole lot of money.

10 years ago, the idea of driving a German car was considered opulent and exclusive. 20 years ago, the average person wouldn't own a BMW/Audi and considered those that did ""Well off"".

With finance being more readily available, even the top of the range models are attainable for those on lower incomes, which in itself isn't bad at all, however this combined with more businesses offering cars for employees and lots of used cars being turned out at the end of every 3 year deal,  the market has become saturated with high-end cars for not a whole lot of money.

Talking on fuel(recharge) costs. Nothing environment/performance or maintenance related.

(Two large range differences, so calculations are very underestimated which favors the Corolla absurdly. Let’s pretend the base Corolla has the same range). 

Base Toyota Corolla (ICE 435 miles). $20,175

Base Tesla Model 3 (50 kw 272 miles) $44,990. 50kw battery. Recharged @0.135 cents per kWh at home = $7.29 a week.

In my unpopular opinion, although the base model 3 is faster (still very sluggish vs the $52k long range non performance model 3 ) the interiors and exteriors of both are OK and nothing overly exciting. They are similar in size. 

It would take you 9+ years of driving, or over 128,000 miles to offset fuel costs by charging ONLY at home for the price of a Model 3. That’s at minimum, as the Corolla has a 30%+ range.

Mobile apps are out of control.,"Everywhere I go now with my wife it's the same shit, stand off to the side of the store while she scrolls the businesses app for some stupid deal or to accumulate points. It to a point of absurdity. We go in Target it's acan every damn item to see if it's on sale or has some reward attached to it. Same at the grocery store. I just stopped for lunch at a fast food joint while out and mentioned it to here...""you should have used the app. I have a free blah blah and I would get double points.""

Man, ok, I get it if you're budgeting and using them for deals and coupons whatever. We aren't in a financial situation where that's necessary. And it's not even always that. She drives through Starbucks and for some fucking reason I can't figure out they just have to scan her app before she drives off. 

How do people that do this not get tired of being so dependent on an app. Before you know it I am going to need one to take a dump.",unpopularopinion,1646070983,1,"Mobile apps are out of control.Everywhere I go now with my wife it's the same shit, stand off to the side of the store while she scrolls the businesses app for some stupid deal or to accumulate points.

Manifesting is real,"People are not going to believe me because they think it’s only spiritual and it can’t be proven. But I wouldn’t think of it as just spiritual. I garuntee you that philosophers and scientists would back me up on this. 

If you don’t know what manifesting is, It’s when you want something in life really bad, but you act like you already have it. The more you do that and convince yourself you have what you want, you will eventually receive whatever it is you want. People have a hard time believing that because they can’t possibly think it’s that easy. 

I think of manifesting as a positive state of mind. I mean think about it, all of our lives we are taught to believe in our dreams. The more you believe the more it will eventually be handed to you. There are many stories of how legends and celebrities have manifested their dreams to get to where they are now. For example Ed Sheeren, Halsey, Demi Lovato, etc manifested. And look where they are now. 

Another argument is that we all have Newfie’s and the universe has frequencies. There’s a real thing from scientists that’s called “The Law of Attraction.” The rule is that if you put enough energy and frequency on something with an emotion, you’re going to attract it. That’s how the universe works. 

The only reason why manifesting doesn’t work for you is because you don’t 100% believe in what you are manifesting. In order to manifest, you can’t have doubts

It’s bizarre and petty to have a day of the week that is your least or most favorite.,"It’s fine if you’re least favorite day is the one where you return to your job after some time off, but don’t blame Monday for you accepting a job with M-F hours, didn’t you see that on the offer letter before you agreed to take the job? TGIF? Maybe you’ve never worked a closing restaurant shift and then Saturday brunch the next morning. 

It’s not the day’s fault, it’s your schedule’s fault.

Porn is not a bad way of being introduced to sex,"First of all, I think people underestimate just how many people are introduced to sex through porn. We live in the internet age where 13 and 14-year-olds can google anything they want, the inevitably start seeking out sexual material and stumble upon porn. The kids that are introduced to sex through sex-ed before porn are very few. Yet most people have satisfactory sex and know how to use a condom.


&gt;But porn doesn't depict foreplay which is important for good sex


We see foreplay in movies all the time. No one is going to skip it just because they didn't see it in porn.


&gt;But a lot of people think real sex is like professional porn


This is a tiny minority of people that are so naive that they would fall for something stupid eventually. For most people the difference between brazzers and real sex is as obvious as the difference between an action movie and the news. You only have to watch one amateur porn video to know the difference.


I think our culture over complicates sex in general. My grandparents, great-grandparents and all of my ancestors since they were eukaryotes somehow figured out sex without ever seeing sexual imagery and without a teacher explaining to them what the penis and the vagina is. My cat knows how to have sex and he is so stupid that he drinks toilet water. If you know how to use a condom then what else is there to know?",unpopularopinion,1646070383,1,"Porn is not a bad way of being introduced to sexFirst of all, I think people underestimate just how many people are introduced to sex through porn.
